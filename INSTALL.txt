Installation Notes
==================

Install Python 3.4 or .5 or .6 or so (not sure what minimum requirements are).
  Under Debian based GNU/Linuxes:
    sudo apt install python3

Install the pygame version corresponding to your Python version.
  Under Debian based GNU/Linuxes:
    Debian-based distros do not seem to package Pygame for Python 3, so use pip3:
      sudo apt install python3-pip
      python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user

No reason this shouldn't work with other operating systems, except that Windows will need the icon symlinks replaced with actual copies of the files.
